This project is a simulator for CPU scheduling algorithms. It is built using React and TypeScript.

Algorithms implemented:
- [x] First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- [x] Shortest Job First Preemptive (SJF-P)
- [x] Shortest Job First Non-Preemptive (SJF-NP)
- [x] Round Robin (RR)
- [ ] Priority Scheduling Preemptive
- [ ] Priority Scheduling Non-Preemptive

Stuff to do:

- [ ] Implement Priority Scheduling Algos
- [ ] Add animations to the gantt chart
